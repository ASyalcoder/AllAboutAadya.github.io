		As you probably know already, I am a fan of dogs. <br>
		They are so cute, cuddly, precious...<br>
		I really love portugese water dogs and beagles. <br>
		Portugese water dogs are big, hypoallergenic, loyal, protective dogs.<br>
		Beagles are medium sized, low shedding, caring, companion dogs.<br>
		Although I don't have a dog, I still love them!
