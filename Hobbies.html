		I have many hobbies, things I like to do in my spare time. <br>
		First, I love to draw. I can sit down for hours coloring and sketching. <br>
		Next, I also love reading and writing. I really can get into the world of a book, and I love realistic fiction writing. <br>
		My favorite author would probably be J.K Rowling, Brandon Mull, as well as all the authors that wrote the Who Was series.
		Finally, I love table tennis and chess. Table tennis helps me stay active and chess really challenges my brain. <br>
